This unit is in the back, away from the street, very quiet and peaceful, with both southern and eastern exposure so you have gorgeous natural light and spectacular views of the lagoon from every room all day long. Walk along the flower-strewn path leaving behind the bustle of the city, and then up the stairs to your own private and serene oasis. Watch shorebirds soaring nearby and the sunlight glistening on the water from your large private balcony. Spotlessly clean brand new interior just fully renovated in 2020. All brand new: carpet, paint, granite counters and tile, kitchen and bathroom fixtures, kitchen and bath cabinets, appliances, washer and dryer, and light fixtures. Spotlessly clean throughout. The kitchen is elegant and up to the minute in style and functionality with gleaming black granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, designer granite tile floor, and designer lighting. The bathroom is fitted with designer fixtures and granite tile floor and tub surround. Washer and dryer in the unit, off street parking and storage locker included. There is also a larger washer and dryer in the common laundry room. Lots of closet space, including walk-in closet. Walk to shops and restaurants on nearby upscale Park Street and in the Southshore Shopping Center across the street. Five minute drive to the ferry terminal for the S.F. ferry, which takes about 20 minutes for the ride to S.F. Available March 1. This is a rare and truly extraordinary find for the connoisseur of the luminist play of light on water, the movement of trees, and the flight of birds. Must see to appreciate. I have been installing ev plugs as the units turn over and tenants with electric cars move in. If you have an electric car, I can install an ev plug in the carport at your parking space at no charge.

This suite contains a large-screen TV and can also be used as a media room if not needed for a bedroom (see photos). The sofa bed is a comfortable queen-size gel mattress with European topper. On the second floor are three sleeping options: A large master bedroom suite with a king-size bed and en-suite luxury bath, a second bedroom with a comfortable queen bed, a sun room with a daybed and a beautiful view of San Francisco and the western sky. The second floor shared bathroom has both a walk-in shower and relaxing Japanese soaking tub. The third floor sleeping loft, with a warm tree-house feel, is accessible by Japanese ladder from the second-floor landing (and requires a fairly nimble person willing to climb there!), contains a double futon bed with a view of the lights of San Francisco and the Bay--a magical tree-house like space. The back yard has a deck and small patio table right off the kitchen, plus a large patio a few steps lower with a table that seats six. The garden is sunny and quiet, with multiple levels for reading and entertaining. There is plenty of street parking. High-speed wifi is available throughout the house. Rockridge is one of the most desired neighborhoods of the East Bay, lined with charming homes, many dating from the Arts & Crafts era. Bustling College Avenue is a four-block walk away along tree-lined streets, offering some of the East Bays most interesting shops and finest restaurants (Olivetos, A16, A Cot). The Rockridge BART station is six blocks away, meaning that downtown San Francisco is accessible by comfortable high-speed public transportation in just 25 minutes. The UC-Berkeley campus is 1-1/2 miles away. There is easy freeway access six blocks away, leading to San Francisco, Berkeley, Walnut Creek, and Marin County. Multiple hiking trails in the redwoods or along the crest of the East Bay hills are within a 10-minute drive."

Owner pays for water, sewer, and trash/recycling Tenant pays for internet, electricity, gas, heat. Each unit is separately metered for electricity and gas. Unit is ready for Comcast or Sonic Internet and can accommodate whatever internet service you choose. Proximity to UC Berkeley has made this apartment popular with UC faculty and staff. And easy access to public transportation, casual carpools, and freeways has also made it convenient for folks who work in San Francisco. We prefer a 12-month lease, after which it goes month-to-month. No one living in this building has ever had covid and all have been vaccinated and boosted. If you are interested in this apartment, please respond by email. And if you have any questions, please feel free to ask. Thank you."

            "text": "Situated on the top floor of a well-kept Victorian home on a tree-lined Bicycle Boulevard in the desirable Elmwood/Willard Park district, this charming one-bedroom apartment is one-of-a-kind. It is also safe and secure. Access to the building is through a main entrance door into the foyer, and then up a bannistered stairway. The main dining/living room has eastern exposure so it gets wonderful morning light. Double-hung windows look out at lovely mature magnolias where hummingbirds have been known to nest. The flooring is recently refinished solid oak parquetry including mahogany border trim and an in-laid eastern star to mark the sunrise. It is a perfect space for morning meditation and yoga. The kitchen is a separate room and boasts an excellent vintage gas stove/oven and lots of drawers and cupboards for storage. It also has a vintage hide-away ironing board with brand-new cover. The bedroom is large, has a closet. The flooring is natural oak. Windows face south so it gets nice light during the day. The bathroom has all the usuals including a full-size bathtub/shower surrounded by ceramic tile. There are also built-in storage cupboards in the front hallway. A washer and dryer are in the basement; they can be used on a pay per use basis. The apartment has a separate meter for gas and electricity. Furnace is also in the basement and has ducts to this unit. Tenant has own thermostat to control heating. Conveniently located near shopping and many restaurants and coffee shops, it is only 3 minutes to the Elmwood Shopping and Restaurant District by bicycle, 4 minutes to Whole Foods, 2 minutes to the Willard Park tennis courts, and 5 minutes to UC Berkeley campus. Indeed, it is a Bikers Paradise. This location is also a Walkers Paradise with a score of 96. And with its proximity to the excellent hiking and running trails, it is also a paradise for hikers and runners. It is only 15-minute walk or 7-minute run to the main entrance to the Claremont Canyon Regional Preserve which gives you access to the Stonewall-Panoramic Trail, Strawberry Canyon Fire Trail, and a dozen other trails allowing you to run, hike, and explore the natural beauty of the east bay hills. It is also close to the running track above the Clark Kerr campus which is a great place to run, work out, and watch the sunset. This home also has access to good public transit, and is within the Gig car share Home Zone, with many other car share options nearby. If interested, ask about off-street parking. Other important stuff: The owner/manager lives and works in the building and is responsive to tenants. The house is clean and quiet and we are seeking a quiet and responsible tenant who would fit well in that environment. Smoking, pets, loud music, and waterbeds are not allowed. Owner pays for water, sewer, and trash/recycling Tenant pays for internet, electricity, gas, heat. Each unit is separately metered for electricity and gas. Unit is ready for Comcast or Sonic Internet and can accommodate whatever internet service you choose. Proximity to UC Berkeley has made this apartment popular with UC faculty and staff. And easy access to public transportation, casual carpools, and freeways has also made it convenient for folks who work in San Francisco. We prefer a 12-month lease, after which it goes month-to-month. No one living in this building has ever had covid and all have been vaccinated and boosted. If you are interested in this apartment, please respond by email. And if you have any questions, please feel free to ask. Thank you."

            "text": "Hi there, We have a studio apartment thats located right below our house near downtown Martinez on a hill in a very quiet/awesome neighborhood. If youre a minimalist or a fan of the tiny house movement this place would definitely make you feel right at home. The studio itself is around 200 ft. but it is packed with all the conveniences of modern day living. Its perfect for one person or a couple max. Check out the pictures and email me if youre interested in talking more. We have chickens and love animals so this home would be good for someone that doesnt mind sounds of the country and a kid playing. There is a washer and dryer in the studio located in the bathroom. The studio has air conditioning and heating. Rent would be $1,450/mo and the utilities that would be your part would be $150/mo. So $1,600/mo. That would include garbage, water and solar/power. If your water usage exceeded the average amount then we'd ask you to pay for your additional water usage. The internet connection is there but you would have to add that service with Comcast in your name and pay for that bill directly. We would like 1st months rent and a security deposit at the time if we signed a lease with you. That full amount would be $3,050. The lease term would be for 1 year. Unfortunately our yard isnt fully fenced in so we are saying no to dogs. Sorry, we do love dogs it just wouldnt work well. Also no smoking or vaping in the studio or on our property. Our house is not wheelchair accessible. There are stairs going up to the studio. Please tell me more about you if your interested! Place will be available to see/rent after March 15th. Thanks for reading :)"

Please feel free to drive by, but please dont disturb present occupants. I received a note recently from outgoing tenants who have just purchased a house. In response to my question, they wrote: The main features of the apartment that weve enjoyed are the natural light and the fact that the unit is on the top floor. Also, the 10 minute walk to Ashby BART has been great. Ive been making that walk every day for two years now, and its a breeze. NOTE: rear yard of this property is on the Berkeley city line but its actual address is Oakland. The next closest posting location on Craigslist after Berkeley is Temescal, and Bakesale Betty's, for example, in the heart of Temescal, is fifteen blocks away. If you need a Berkeley postal address for school registration or other purpose this is not the right place for you.

The lease is one year and turns to month to month after that (nine-month lease option also available for $100 more per month). Reply to listing for direct contact with building manager. This is a giant (29' x 38' roughly) second-floor two-bedroom corner unit with more style and size than probably any other around! The unit has a huge living room and large eat-in kitchen. There is lots of natural light, views of the bay, hardwood floors, a gas stove, and you're two stories off the ground as well as away from the street. There's a large walk-in closet in the living room, closets in the bedrooms, a closet in the entryway, and lots of cabinet storage throughout the unit. The windows are wood-trimmed and the walls have dimmer-controlled wall sconces. The building pays water, hot water, and heat since the building is heated by a steam heating system. NO PETS. The large backyard area is like a park and includes twenty vegetable garden plots. Three monthly parking options are available: $65 in the rear parking lot, $80 inside the under-building garage and $100 for independent garage units. There is also a coin-operated laundry room on-site. Radcliffe Arms is close to Berkeley campus, Whole Foods, Berkeley Bowl, the shops on College Ave, and much more. There is a bus stop one block up on Telegraph Avenue, and the Ashby Bart station is a short walk. This isn't your normal two-bedroom apartment. It's a second-floor corner unit with bay windows that's located on the rear of the building overlooking the building's private garden. The kitchen feels like a house and with everything from the backyard, location, and style, you'll like it. People dont move that often so these go quickly. Its an unusual building. The pictures and video are of the available unit. After viewing everything, you'll understand how amazing and unique this building is with its spacious units, vast serene private backyard, and historic charm. Please see the video link posted below. It's the virtual walk through of the available two bedroom unit in the building. Due to COVID-19, weve modified our showing practices to help reduce potential exposure by adopting a virtual showing (youtube video link below) for the initial walkthrough. Interested applicants can then schedule a private on-site walkthrough. All unit showings will be by appointment only. If you are interested in applying or scheduling an on-site walkthrough, please reply to this listing. Throughout this process we will utilize remote methods to complete necessary document signing. We have implemented proactive measures related to health and safety for both our building occupants and visiting guests viewing vacant units. Limiting the number of people entering apartments helps us keep the unit thoroughly sterilized, decreasing any potential risks of transference. Thanks in advance and for your understanding. https://youtu.be/Rd23MvVVvEI"

Rent is $745 (w/o utilities, which hover around $150). please read below to see if you'd like living with us, and reply with a bit more about yourself. ~the space~ Right down the street from BART, Mandela Grocery, Bottoms Up community garden, and quick highway access parking isn't tough to find (but there are parking permit spots and street sweeping days you gotta watch out for!), and we also have a rotating off-street parking spot available in our garden area; + space for yr bike in the hallway laundry & dishwasher! there's some cheeky roof access that's nice for watching the sunset backyard garden area with outdoor seating (cigs and 420 alright outside) all the neighbors in the building are friendly and cross-paths in the shared outdoor space Currently, there is one cat, which aren't technically allowed in our lease... shhhh. Would prefer no other pets at this time. ~the roomies~ D: 35 year old, works in SF doing custom art framing. Enjoys music, art, movie etc. A bit of a night owl. Generally keeps to himself and spends most time in bedroom, but outgoing and social as well. K: 25, working in child care, crafting and design. Usually browsing the net, listening to music cooking. Sometimes a night owl. J: 33 year old lover of all things nature-related. My work is fully remote but enjoy swimming, creating, and music during my free time. ~living vibe~ we live our own lives, but care about one another and want to ensure we're all happy and comfortable in our home; group text to touch base on things and are all receptive to expressed needs tidiness - no chore wheels, just clean on our own accord and don't want to leave our messes behind for someone else to have to deal with; no dishes in the sink for more than a day - we have a dishwasher afterall ;) partners & friends - more than welcomed, but it's not every night or live-in. with COVID, we've just been giving roomies a heads up noise level - we like to play music and do our thing during the day, but quiet down around 11pm; bringing the party back to our place wouldn't work well in this space all of us love to cook, and our schedules / large kitchen make it work - we do eat meat and store it in the fridge Overall, we're just very easy going people that cherish the space and like to make it feel like a home!"
